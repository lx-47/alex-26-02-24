# Code Analysis
- The codebase contains several instances of magic numbers, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose of certain values. It would be beneficial to define these values as constants at the top of the file or in a separate constants.py file.
- There are no docstrings for functions or classes, making it difficult for other developers to understand their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings will improve the readability and maintainability of the codebase.
- The use of global variables should be minimized, as they can make the code difficult to understand and test. Instead, consider passing necessary variables as arguments to functions.
- There are several instances of hardcoded file paths, which can make the code less portable. Consider using environment variables or command line arguments to specify file paths.
- The codebase contains several print statements that are used for debugging. These should be removed or replaced with proper logging statements.
- The use of list comprehension can be optimized in some places, such as in the `get_file_contents` function.
- The `process_file` function can be further optimized by removing unnecessary checks and using more efficient algorithms.
- The `main` function contains a lot of repetitive code that can be refactored into separate functions.
- The codebase contains several instances of nested if-else statements, which can make the code difficult to read and maintain. Consider using early returns or guard clauses to simplify the code.
- The use of type annotations can be improved to make the code more readable and maintainable.
